Puff is an incredibly awkward matchup for Falco at the lower/mid level. Especially when it feels like you can play 30 seconds of *perfect gameplay* but missing a single upthrow DI costs you a stock. However, if you optimise your positioning, patience and punish you might find that Falco vs Puff is actually not as bad as you think.

## General Ideas
* This matchup revolves around the 3 P's:

* Positioning 
  * Make sure you truly understand puff's bair range
  * Stage control is incredibly important, never back yourself into a corner
  * Coming down on puff seems like a good idea, it is not
* Patience
  * Never contest puff if she has her back to you, laser to turn her around
  * Don't throw yourself at her, take it slow and chip away at her space
  * When puff is off-stage, don't go bird brain mode, she will punish poor edgeguard attempts
* Punish
  * Ensure you have solid rest punishes up to KO percent
  * Be familiar with DI mixups and her ASDI options
  * Learn how falco's throws work

## Positioning Concepts
### The Invisible Lines
Picture two lines that intersect the side platforms on battlefield like so:
![Desktop View](/assets/img/2026-02-24-puff/spacing.jpeg){: width="972" height="589" .w-75 .normal}  
Generally you always want to remain within these lines. 
This seems like an obvious concept and applies to most matchups, but many falcos will back themselves to the edge without realising. 
### The Top Platform
The top platform is a fantastic escape option to get out of the corner. Ledgedash fullhop dair to top plat is nearly unpunishable by puff. The trick is getting down once you're on the top plat, make sure you have a safe way to descend, ideally via side plat to avoid upairs.

### KO Percents
> Key  
Stage (perfect DI KO percent/worst DI KO percent)  
I've also included safe numbers, which account for perfect DI on most stages
{: .prompt-tip } 
<details><summary>Dtilt</summary>
The perfect DI on dtilt is near impossible to hit consistently, so I've adjusted for cardinals.<br>  
Also assuming 0 in stale queue, as you shouldn't really be dtilting puff unless you plan to KO.<br>
YS (82/72)<br>
PS (85/76)<br>
FD (87/77)<br>
BF (90/80)<br>
FoD (91/80)<br>
DL (102/91)<br>
Safe number: 91.
</details>

<details><summary>Upsmash</summary>
Assuming 0 in stale queue, as you shouldn't really be upsmashing puff unless you plan to KO.<br>
YS (94/87)<br>
PS (97/90)<br>
FD (99/93)<br>
BF (103/96)<br>
FOD (104/96)<br>
DL (116/108)<br>
Safe number: 104.

## Stages
The stages in this matchup are fairly set in stone, but just to lay out some things to consider:  

<details><summary>Battlefield</summary> 
Usually the starter stage assuming puff bans YS and PS (or FD depending on ruleset)
<p style="color:green;">Highest top platform of the legal stages</p>
<p style="color:red;">YS, PS and FD all have lower ceiling blastzones relative to the ground, vertical KO moves require a few more percent</p>
<p style="color:red;">Unable to ride the wall and less opportunities to tech, so recovering can be trickier</p>
</details>

<details><summary>Yoshi's Story</summary>
<p style="color:green;">Significantly smaller blastzones than every other stage</p>
<p style="color:green;">A reliable wall makes sweetspotting and recovering easier</p>
<p style="color:green;">The stage is very narrow, so more combos will lead to the top platform allowing for shine KO's off the top</p>
<p style="color:red;">Keep in mind that you're always closer to a ledge on YS, so it's easier to get reversaled and edgeguarded</p>
</details>

<details><summary>Pokemon Stadium</summary>
<p style="color:green;">Low ceiling</p>
<p style="color:red;">No way for falco to use a top platform as a corner escape</p>
</details>

<details><summary>Final Destination</summary>
<p style="color:green;">No opportunity for puff to platform techchase</p>
<p style="color:green;">No way for puff to slow down the game by retreating to a platform</p>
<p style="color:green;">Fairly low ceiling</p>
<p style="color:red;">No way for falco to use a top platform as a corner escape</p>
<p style="color:red;">Far distance to the vertical side blastzones means bair won't KO till higher percents compared to other stages</p>
</details>

<details><summary>Fountain of Dreams</summary>
FoD is often an insta-ban for many falcos, prefering the consistency of dreamland. I would argue FoD actually has better blastzones than battlefield.
<p style="color:green;">The vertical side blastzones are misleadingly small, second only to YS, allowing for earlier bair kills than expected</p>
<p style="color:red;">Platforms</p>
</details>

<details><summary>Dreamland</summary>
<p style="color:red;">The furthest blastzones by a huge margin</p>
<p style="color:red;">Kill percents can be 10/20% higher than every other stage</p>
<p style="color:green;">You might live some rests that would otherwise KO you</p>
</details>
