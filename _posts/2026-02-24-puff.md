Puff is an incredibly awkward matchup for Falco at the lower/mid level. Especially when it feels like you can play 30 seconds of *perfect gameplay* but missing a single upthrow DI costs you a stock. However, if you optimise your positioning, patience and punish you might find that Falco vs Puff is actually not as bad as you think.

## General Ideas
* This matchup revolves around the 3 P's:

* Positioning 
  * Make sure you truly understand Puff's Bair range
  * Stage control is incredibly important, never back yourself into a corner
  * Coming down on puff seems like a good idea, it is not
* Patience
  * Never contest puff if she has her back to you, laser to turn her around
  * Don't throw yourself at her, take it slow and chip away at her space
  * When puff is off-stage, don't go bird brain mode, she will punish poor edgeguard attempts
* Punish
  * Ensure you have solid rest punishes up to kill percent
  * Be familiar with DI mixups and her ASDI options

## Positioning Concepts
### The Invisible Lines
Picture two lines that intersect the side platforms on battlefield like so:
![Desktop View](/assets/img/2026-02-24-puff/spacing.jpeg){: width="972" height="589" .w-75 .normal}  
Generally you always want to remain within these lines. 
This seems like an obvious concept and applies to most matchups, but many falco's will back themselves to the edge without realising. 
### The Top Platform

### Kill Percents
> Key  
Stage (perfect DI kill percent/worst DI kill percent)  
I've also included safe numbers, which account for perfect DI on most stages

<details><summary>Dtilt</summary>
The perfect DI on dtilt is near impossible to hit consistently, so I've adjusted for cardinals.<br>  
Also assuming 0 in stale queue, as you shouldn't really be dtilting puff unless you plan to KO.<br>
YS (82/72)<br>
PS (85/76)<br>
FD (87/77)<br>
BF (90/80)<br>
FoD (91/80)<br>
DL (102/91)<br>
Safe number: 91.
