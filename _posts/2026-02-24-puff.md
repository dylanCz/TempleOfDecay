Puff is an incredibly awkward matchup for Falco at the lower/mid level. Especially when it feels like you can play 30 seconds of *perfect gameplay* but missing a single upthrow DI costs you a stock. However, if you optimise your positioning, patience and punish you might find that Falco vs Puff is actually not as bad as you think.

## General Ideas
* This matchup revolves around the 3 P's:

* Positioning 
  * Make sure you truly understand Puff's Bair range
  * Stage control is incredibly important, never back yourself into a corner
  * Coming down on puff seems like a good idea, it is not
* Patience
  * Never contest puff if she has her back to you, laser to turn her around
  * Don't throw yourself at her, take it slow and chip away at her space
  * When puff is off-stage, don't go bird brain mode, she will punish poor edgeguard attempts
* Punish
  * Ensure you have solid rest punishes up to KO percent
  * Be familiar with DI mixups and her ASDI options

## Positioning Concepts
### The Invisible Lines
Picture two lines that intersect the side platforms on battlefield like so:
![Desktop View](/assets/img/2026-02-24-puff/spacing.jpeg){: width="972" height="589" .w-75 .normal}  
Generally you always want to remain within these lines. 
This seems like an obvious concept and applies to most matchups, but many falcos will back themselves to the edge without realising. 
### The Top Platform



## Important Percentages
### Defensive
18% is when falco is knocked down by puff's uair  
74% is when falco can no longer CC puff's bair, however it can be Amsah teched

### Offensive
31% is when puff is knocked down by falco's dair

### KO Percents
> Key  
Stage (perfect DI KO percent/worst DI KO percent)  
I've also included safe numbers, which account for perfect DI on most stages

<details><summary>Dtilt</summary>
The perfect DI on dtilt is near impossible to hit consistently, so I've adjusted for cardinals.<br>  
Also assuming 0 in stale queue, as you shouldn't really be dtilting puff unless you plan to KO.<br>
YS (82/72)<br>
PS (85/76)<br>
FD (87/77)<br>
BF (90/80)<br>
FoD (91/80)<br>
DL (102/91)<br>
Safe number: 91.

<details><summary>Upsmash</summary>
Assuming 0 in stale queue, as you shouldn't really be upsmashing puff unless you plan to KO.<br>

BF (103/96)<br>
FOD (104/96)<br>

Safe number: 104.

## Stages
The stages in this matchup are fairly set in stone, but just to lay out some things to consider:  

### Battlefield
Usually the starter stage assuming puff bans YS and PS (or FD depending on ruleset)
* Highest top platform of the legal stages
* YS, PS and FD all have lower ceiling blastzones relative to the ground, vertical KO moves require a few more percent
* Unable to ride the wall or tech, so recovering can be trickier

### Yoshi's Story
* Significantly smaller blastzones than every other stage
* A reliable wall makes sweetspotting and recovering easier
* The stage is very narrow, so more combos will lead to the top platform allowing for easy shine KO's off the top
* Keep in mind that you're always closer to a ledge on YS, so it's easier to get reversaled and edgeguarded

### Pokemon Stadium

### Final Destination
* No platforms
  * No oppertunity for puff to platform techchase
  * No way for puff to slow down the game by retreating to a platform
* Large horizontal blastzones means bair won't KO till higher percents

### Fountain of Dreams

### Dreamland

## Players to Watch
### Ginger

Believe it or not, Joey Donuts and Hungrybox have played 5 (at the time of writing this) online sets and the standings are... 4-1 Joey Donuts?!  
Online or not, Joey has an incredible record against the greatest puff of all time, all 5 sets are worth watching.
