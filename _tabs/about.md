Hey, my name's Dylan and I go by Decay (previously Maskless) in the SSBM community. 
I created this site to track my labbing/notes and allow others to view!  
Major shoutout to [ChurchOfSP](https://churchofsp.netlify.app/), of which this site is heavily inspired by.  
If you want to reach out to me you can find me on my [Github](https://github.com/DylanCz) and [Bluesky](https://bsky.app/profile/maskless.bsky.social).
